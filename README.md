# Bookstore
Books I have at home :^)

Design is adapted from the soulful [MangaGamer](https://www.mangagamer.com)
website with several changes. Notably, most design-related images are converted
to SVG, from headings to the site logo, enabling dynamic color changes when the
site theme is changed. Images where images make sense still exist e.g. book
covers.

The website supports theme customization through a custom built theming engine
consuming Base16 colors (using the first 8 base colors). Besides the default
mangagamer theme, there are 182 available themes. These themes are from
[base16-schemes-source](https://github.com/chriskempson/base16-schemes-source).
In fact, I made the
[default mangagamer theme](/src/main/resources/static/builtin-themes/default-mangagamer.yml)
keeping how the first 8 colors of base16 schemes are chosen in mind: darker to
lighter colors (reverse if light theme).

## Getting Started
### For Users
You can browse books, read reviews, and engage with the community by writing
your own reviews, commenting on others, or even creating a custom theme to
personalize the site's colors to your liking.

Although, to change the theme, make reviews and comments, you'd need to create
an account. If you don't need that, then you can browse as anon just fine!

### For Developers

#### Prerequisites

- **Java 21 or higher**: The project is built using Java 21.
- **Maven**: To manage dependencies and build the project.
- **PostgreSQL**: The database used for storing all application data.

#### Setup

1.  **Clone the Repository**:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/am-cid/Bookstore.git
    cd Bookstore
    ```

2. **Configure Environment Variables**

    Spring Boot automatically reads system environment variables. You must set
    the following before running the application.

    ```bash
    export PSQL_USERNAME=your_db_username
    export PSQL_PASSWORD=your_db_password
    export BS_USERNAME=admin
    export BS_PASSWORD=1234
    ```

    The `UserSeeder` uses these variables to create the default admin user. If
    `BS_USERNAME` and `BS_PASSWORD` are not provided, they default to `admin`
    and `1234` respectively, as configured in `application.properties`.
    `PSQL_*` are your PostgreSQL credentials that you want to use.


3. **Create Database Table (Conditional)**
    - **For `dev` profile**: No action is required. Your
    `application-dev.properties` is set to
    `spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=create-drop`, which means the database
    schema is automatically created and destroyed on each application restart.
    - **For `prod` profile**: Before running the application for the first
    time, you must ensure the `bookstore` database exists in your PostgreSQL
    instance. The schema itself will be managed by Liquibase. You can create
    the database with a command like `CREATE DATABASE bookstore;` in your
    PostgreSQL client.


4.  **Run with Maven**:

    Run the application in `dev` mode, which will automatically seed the
    database.

    ```bash
    ./mvnw spring-boot:run
    ```

    To run in `prod` mode, which enables Liquibase and skips data seeding, use:

    ```bash
    ./mvnw spring-boot:run -Dspring-boot.run.profiles=prod
    ```

#### Database and Profiles

- **`dev` profile**:

    - `spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=create-drop`
    - `spring.liquibase.enabled=false`
    - Seeding is enabled via `CommandLineRunner`s to populate the database with
    sample data.

- **`prod` profile**:

    - `spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update`
    - `spring.liquibase.enabled=true`
    - Seeding is disabled. The application expects the database to be managed
    via Liquibase.
